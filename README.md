  # Welcome to my PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

  The purpose of why I did a portfolio website was to display my skills and showcase my portfolio.
  
  For now, it's just a one-paged website. I have created this initial website design and coded it for just a very short amount of time.
  It is not responsive, or functional yet. Just a simple static site. 
  
  I will only be able to work on this (and my other personal projects) during weekends since I have a full-time job at weekdays.
  
  However, I can't wait till this site is finished. I'm sure it's going to be awesome!
